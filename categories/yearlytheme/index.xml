      <description>After my last post about my yearly theme I thought I’d write some posts about what I actually do to take care of myself in 2021. One of the biggest changes I’ve made started prior to 2021 that will be with me for years to come is running. I’m not a particularly fast runner, but I am proud of the progression I’ve made since I started.
A while back I was at a low point in my life where I was mentally depleted and physically unhealthy.</description>

      <description>As a regular listener to the Cortex podcast on Relay FM I’ve become interested in their discussions on yearly themes every year. This year I’ve decided to set one for myself.
As I regularly fail New Years resolutions, the idea of setting a theme for the year seemed like a better way to bring about some positive change. There are no rules to the yearly themes. CGP Grey has a good video on the topic that explains it clearly.</description>
