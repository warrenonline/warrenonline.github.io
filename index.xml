      <description>As a regular listener to the Cortex podcast on Relay FM I’ve become interested in their discussions on yearly themes every year. This year I’ve decided to set one for myself.
As I regularly fail New Years resolutions, the idea of setting a theme for the year seemed like a better way to bring about some positive change. There are no rules to the yearly themes. CGP Grey has a good video on the topic that explains it clearly.</description>

      <description>My thoughts about coming back to writing started with an article I read by Ana Rodrigues last month. Long ago I was blogging and sharing links on my own domain before there was Twitter and Facebook. I ran the server off my home computer, that I built myself, and wrote the HTML on a document that I uploaded with FTP. Back then I experimented with Linux, FreeBSD and different content management systems.</description>
