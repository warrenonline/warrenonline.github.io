      <h2>Longevity</h2>
          <h3>February 27, 2021</h3>
          <p>I had struggled with acid reflux for a long time. The constant nausea and burning made things pretty miserable for me. It hit my mental and physical health in a big way. I ate antacids like popcorn, but not much seemed to help. Not until I was prescribed <a href="https://www.drugs.com/monograph/esomeprazole.html">esomeprazole magnesium</a> which is a proton-pump inhibitor sold under the brand name <a href="https://www.drugs.com/nexium.html">Nexium</a>. This was a game changer for me. My acid reflux symptoms disappeared and it was amazing. I think it was because of this that I didn‚Äôt pay close enough attention to the side effects. With my last refill of the esomeprazole magnesium I took a much longer look at it. I have been taking esomeprazole magnesium daily and pretty much eating whatever I wanted for about a year or so.</p>
<p><strong>Esomeprazole is usually given for 4 to 8 weeks only. Your doctor may recommend a second course of treatment if you need additional healing time.</strong></p>
<p>When I had a look at the <a href="https://www.drugs.com/sfx/esomeprazole-side-effects.html">side effects</a> and the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6728776/">long term risks</a> I knew I just had to stop the esomeprazole and make some lifestyle changes.
I <a href="https://solitarian.ca/blog/running">run 3 - 4 times a week</a> but I still weigh in at just under 100 kg. I know that‚Äôs unhealthy, but I‚Äôve been feeling good so I probably didn‚Äôt pay enough attention to that as well. At 53 it‚Äôs something I should be on top of.  I want to be around long enough to see what my kids do with their lives üíï. I‚Äôve decided to taper off the esomeprazole from a daily dose to 3 times a week. I‚Äôll see how that progresses and taper down from there. I think the tapering will be important to maintain my physical and mental health. I‚Äôd be an idiot to think that was going to solve the problem though.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm going to have to approach this the same way I did with running. This also fits in well with my <a href="https://solitarian.ca/blog/yearly-theme">yearly theme</a>. I‚Äôm going to use the <a href="https://www.myfitnesspal.com/">My Fitness Pal</a> application to keep track of calories and how I‚Äôm eating. I find food tracking difficult, so I‚Äôm going to pair this with the ‚ÄúFood Notes‚Äù option at the bottom for a kind of food journal. I had thought about using a separate app for this, but I didn‚Äôt want to over complicate it. I‚Äôm going to have to pay more attention to what I‚Äôm eating, how much I‚Äôm eating and when. I need to control my diet and lose weight.</p>
<p>I know I can succeed at this. I‚Äôm going to use all the tools I have to stay on the positive track I‚Äôve been on for a while now.</p>
