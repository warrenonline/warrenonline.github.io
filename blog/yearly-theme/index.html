      <h2>Yearly Theme</h2>
          <h3>December 31, 2020</h3>
          <p>As a regular listener to the <a href="https://www.relay.fm/cortex">Cortex</a> podcast on <a href="https://www.relay.fm">Relay FM</a> I’ve become interested in their discussions on <a href="https://www.relay.fm/cortex/110">yearly themes</a> every year. This year I’ve decided to set one for myself.</p>
<p>As I regularly fail New Years resolutions, the idea of setting a theme for the year seemed like a better way to bring about some positive change. There are no rules to the yearly themes. CGP Grey has a <a href="https://youtu.be/NVGuFdX5guE">good video</a> on the topic that explains it clearly.  This year I’ve decided the theme will be <strong>Year of Self-Care</strong>.</p>
<p>I did a lot of thinking to get to this yearly theme. With a title like ‘Year of Self-Care’ it sounds self indulgent. This isn’t the case as this is not a year to spoil myself or go to excess. I’ve learned that when I am in a good place with myself I am at my best. I am happier, more creative and interact better with the world. This is also clear in my relationship with my family. When I feel better I can be more patient and communicative. The previous year has been difficult for everyone, so I’m going to bring about some positive change for myself. This should result in positive change for the people around me.</p>
<p>I see the Year of Self-Care having two main pillars. Physical Health and Mental Health. This isn’t a year of self-improvement because I don’t see myself in a bad place and needing to be fixed. The idea is to make good choices around physical and mental health to bring about positive change.</p>
<p>The first thing I’m doing for the Year of Self-Care is this blog post. I believe the act of writing this down is a creative process that will go directly to my mental health. Just getting this post up onto the web got me out of my own head and working on some of my old hobbies. I enjoyed the process and it didn’t feel like work, therefore it is good for the Year of Self-Care.</p>
<p>Here’s to a better year in 2021!</p>
