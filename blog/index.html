          <div>Longevity</div>
    <div>I had struggled with acid reflux for a long time. The constant nausea and burning made things pretty miserable for me. It hit my mental and physical health in a big way. I ate antacids like popcorn, but not much seemed to help. Not until I was prescribed esomeprazole magnesium which is a proton-pump inhibitor sold under the brand name Nexium. This was a game changer for me. My acid reflux symptoms disappeared and it was amazing.</div>

          <div>Running</div>
    <div>After my last post about my yearly theme I thought I’d write some posts about what I actually do to take care of myself in 2021. One of the biggest changes I’ve made started prior to 2021 that will be with me for years to come is running. I’m not a particularly fast runner, but I am proud of the progression I’ve made since I started.
A while back I was at a low point in my life where I was mentally depleted and physically unhealthy.</div>

          <div>Yearly Theme</div>
    <div>As a regular listener to the Cortex podcast on Relay FM I’ve become interested in their discussions on yearly themes every year. This year I’ve decided to set one for myself.
As I regularly fail New Years resolutions, the idea of setting a theme for the year seemed like a better way to bring about some positive change. There are no rules to the yearly themes. CGP Grey has a good video on the topic that explains it clearly.</div>

          <div>My First Post</div>
    <div>My thoughts about coming back to writing started with an article I read by Ana Rodrigues last month. Long ago I was blogging and sharing links on my own domain before there was Twitter and Facebook. I ran the server off my home computer, that I built myself, and wrote the HTML on a document that I uploaded with FTP. Back then I experimented with Linux, FreeBSD and different content management systems.</div>
