  <p>My thoughts about coming back to writing started with an <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/08/autonomy-online-indieweb/">article</a> I read by <a href="https://ohhelloana.blog">Ana Rodrigues</a> last month. Long ago I was blogging and sharing links on my own domain before there was Twitter and Facebook. I ran the server off my home computer, that I built myself, and wrote the HTML on a document that I uploaded with FTP. Back then I experimented with Linux, FreeBSD and different content management systems. I was continually learning and generally doing it by breaking things and fixing them. I had a pretty good time with all of it.</p>
<p>Over the years my work and my little family kind of eroded how I did things. I started using Twitter on a flip phone and I remember signing up for Facebook long ago. It was easier than the way I had been doing it, so my blog posting eventually tapered off to nothing. I let my domain name expire and never thought twice about the fact that I didn’t actually own my own data anymore. I’ve always run a home server, except its now an Ubuntu media server that I was using to provide movies to my kids. Even that has become something that will end soon as they spend the majority of their time on YouTube. I stopped building and became a passive consumer of content.</p>
<p>After reading about <a href="https://indieweb.org">IndieWeb</a>, it seemed like a throwback to the times I worked on all my own things. Things have changed a lot&hellip; I have a gigabit fibre connection to my house, but I’m not going to host my own server. The ease of getting a small <a href="https://digitalocean.com">virtual private server</a> these days makes the physical hardware pretty unnecessary. I’m not going to build my own machines because I just prefer my iMac now. I wrote this first post in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown">Markdown</a> on an iPad. These are things I never could have predicted way back when I first started all this, so I’m going to mix the new with the old.</p>
<p>I’m looking forward to picking up my old hobbies again. It probably has a lot to do with nostalgia and my kids getting older. I’m going to work through  polishing my skills that have gotten rusty and adding new ones as I go.</p>
