      <h2>Running</h2>
          <h3>January 30, 2021</h3>
          <p>After my last post about my <a href="https://solitarian.ca/blog/yearly-theme/">yearly theme</a> I thought I’d write some posts about what I actually do to take care of myself in 2021. One of the biggest changes I’ve made started prior to 2021 that will be with me for years to come is running. I’m not a particularly fast runner, but I am proud of the progression I’ve made since I started.</p>
<p>A while back I was at a low point in my life where I was mentally depleted and physically unhealthy. It felt pretty bleak. I looked back to periods of my life when I did feel better. When I was in training I had to run despite hating it and I felt good once I got going. I had nothing else, so I decided to run.</p>
<p>In the beginning I went out for short runs a few times and couldn’t get the rhythm right. I struggled with lack of fitness and I was having trouble with motivation. I read articles on how to run but nothing stuck. I’ve been a geek my whole life, so I finally looked to technology to give me a boost. One of the articles I read mentioned the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/adidas-runtastic-running-app/id336599882">Runtastic</a> app, so I gave it a try. Runtastic, now owned by Adidas, had built in training plans for beginners. I started a couch to 5K plan and that got me moving. The plan started with a walk / run combo at 15 minutes at a time and it made all the difference. The app gave me a plan, a schedule and the motivation to get out the door and move. Routine was key.</p>
<p>If it wasn’t for the tech the got me going I don’t think that I would consider myself a runner today. The Runtastic app started me with a progressive plan and milestones I could achieve. My Apple watch and iPhone provide my heart rate, distances, GPS and entertainment. I listen to <a href="https://relay.fm">podcasts</a> and music while I run. I still use Runtastic for running plans and I run a minimum of 3 times a week now. My longest run so far has been 17 kilometres and I’ve run over 2 hours continuously . I’m proud of how far I’ve come and what I’ve accomplished so far.</p>
<p>Running has changed me for the better. I run at least 3 times a week in any kind of weather. The physical activity has massively boosted my mental health. My motivation to run has become discipline and it’s brought positive change to every part of my life. To be honest, when I was in that bleak part of my life I never thought I’d get here. A hard run can beat me up, but I wake up energized now and I feel good. In a year of self care or if your mental heath is depleted I believe physical exercise is the first place to start. If I didn’t take the first steps to change things for myself I think my life would be very different right now.</p>
