  <p>I wrote a <a href="https://solitarian.ca/blog/longevity/">post</a> a while back about stopping esomeprazole magnesium, otherwise know as Nexium. I had thought tapering off would be the best idea to prevent the build up of acid in my stomach. Then for some reason I just didnâ€™t do that. I stopped the esomeprazole magnesium abruptly one day and adjusted my lifestyle pretty quickly. The good news is that I havenâ€™t really had any problems adjusting and I feel a pretty good. I have the odd bout of heartburn, but I know what causes it. I cause it when I get careless or think Iâ€™m doing better on my diet than I actually am.</p>
<p>I listed some things below that have helped me keep my heartburn down. I found the best thing that I have done is reduce my stress level. I know for a fact that being stressed brings on acid reflux and poor eating which just brings on even more acid. Exercise, meditation and a change in attitude have helped everything. I did a lot of reading online and found some other things that really have worked for me in stopping my dependence on esomeprazole magnesium. Iâ€™m not a doctor, so these are just things that I do that help me.</p>
<ul>
<li>I have smaller meals more often during the day. A smaller meal and a snack, like fruit, in between keeps the acid down.</li>
<li>I drink my coffee black, so I put a pinch of baking soda in the cup to reduce the acid. I have 2 cups of coffee in the AM and thatâ€™s it for the day.</li>
<li>When I feel heartburn coming on I eat a small handful ( 15 - 20 ) almonds. From what I read the almonds are alkaline and neutralize some acid.</li>
<li>A banana stops heartburn from setting in. I avoid the really ripe bananas because they are overly sweet and didnâ€™t seem to help as much.</li>
<li>I watch my posture and sit up straight more. I found that my poor posture was pushing acid back up into my esophagus.</li>
<li>I avoid deep fried foods and most tomato based products.</li>
<li>I have a cup of green tea or tea with ginger when my stomach is getting close to burning. I think it helps, but I canâ€™t confirm it 100%.</li>
<li>I have to avoid spicy foods.</li>
<li>I try to sleep on my left side. Apparently this helps because of the <a href="https://www.sleepscore.com/the-one-sleeping-position-to-avoid-for-acid-reflux/">mechanics of your stomach</a>.</li>
<li>When I feel heartburn setting in I rely on an antacid. Since stopping the esomeprazole magnesium and changing my lifestyle I havenâ€™t needed more than that.</li>
</ul>
<p>This seems like a big shift in diet, but it hasnâ€™t been as bad as I thought it would be. I do my best and I give myself credit for a positive change. I still have the odd fried food or tomato sauce depending on how Iâ€™m feeling and itâ€™s been fine. Generally I donâ€™t miss much of it anymore. The thing I really miss is spicy foods&hellip;. I have a collection of hot sauce in the pantry thatâ€™s currently gathering dust. ðŸ˜¢</p>
<p>Besides my stomach feeling better, getting this acid reflux under control has increased my overall well being. Itâ€™s hard to be positive when youâ€™re nauseous all the time and not sleeping. Incremental change can make everything better.</p>
