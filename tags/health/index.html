    <div>I had struggled with acid reflux for a long time. The constant nausea and burning made things pretty miserable for me. It hit my mental and physical health in a big way. I ate antacids like popcorn, but not much seemed to help. Not until I was prescribed esomeprazole magnesium which is a proton-pump inhibitor sold under the brand name Nexium. This was a game changer for me. My acid reflux symptoms disappeared and it was amazing.</div>
