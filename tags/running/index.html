    <div>After my last post about my yearly theme I thought I’d write some posts about what I actually do to take care of myself in 2021. One of the biggest changes I’ve made started prior to 2021 that will be with me for years to come is running. I’m not a particularly fast runner, but I am proud of the progression I’ve made since I started.
A while back I was at a low point in my life where I was mentally depleted and physically unhealthy.</div>
