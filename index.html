          <h2>Longevity</h2>
          <h3>2021-02-27</h3>
          <p>I had struggled with acid reflux for a long time. The constant nausea and burning made things pretty miserable for me. It hit my mental and physical health in a big way. I ate antacids like popcorn, but not much seemed to help. Not until I was prescribed <a href="https://www.drugs.com/monograph/esomeprazole.html">esomeprazole magnesium</a> which is a proton-pump inhibitor sold under the brand name <a href="https://www.drugs.com/nexium.html">Nexium</a>. This was a game changer for me. My acid reflux symptoms disappeared and it was amazing. I think it was because of this that I didn‚Äôt pay close enough attention to the side effects. With my last refill of the esomeprazole magnesium I took a much longer look at it. I have been taking esomeprazole magnesium daily and pretty much eating whatever I wanted for about a year or so.</p>
<p><strong>Esomeprazole is usually given for 4 to 8 weeks only. Your doctor may recommend a second course of treatment if you need additional healing time.</strong></p>
<p>When I had a look at the <a href="https://www.drugs.com/sfx/esomeprazole-side-effects.html">side effects</a> and the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6728776/">long term risks</a> I knew I just had to stop the esomeprazole and make some lifestyle changes.
I <a href="https://solitarian.ca/blog/running">run 3 - 4 times a week</a> but I still weigh in at just under 100 kg. I know that‚Äôs unhealthy, but I‚Äôve been feeling good so I probably didn‚Äôt pay enough attention to that as well. At 53 it‚Äôs something I should be on top of.  I want to be around long enough to see what my kids do with their lives üíï. I‚Äôve decided to taper off the esomeprazole from a daily dose to 3 times a week. I‚Äôll see how that progresses and taper down from there. I think the tapering will be important to maintain my physical and mental health. I‚Äôd be an idiot to think that was going to solve the problem though.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm going to have to approach this the same way I did with running. This also fits in well with my <a href="https://solitarian.ca/blog/yearly-theme">yearly theme</a>. I‚Äôm going to use the <a href="https://www.myfitnesspal.com/">My Fitness Pal</a> application to keep track of calories and how I‚Äôm eating. I find food tracking difficult, so I‚Äôm going to pair this with the ‚ÄúFood Notes‚Äù option at the bottom for a kind of food journal. I had thought about using a separate app for this, but I didn‚Äôt want to over complicate it. I‚Äôm going to have to pay more attention to what I‚Äôm eating, how much I‚Äôm eating and when. I need to control my diet and lose weight.</p>
<p>I know I can succeed at this. I‚Äôm going to use all the tools I have to stay on the positive track I‚Äôve been on for a while now.</p>

  After my last post about my yearly theme I thought I‚Äôd write some posts about what I actually do to take care of myself in 2021. One of the biggest changes I‚Äôve made started prior to 2021 that will be with me for years to come is running. I‚Äôm not a particularly fast runner, but I am proud of the progression I‚Äôve made since I started.
A while back I was at a low point in my life where I was mentally depleted and physically unhealthy.

  As a regular listener to the Cortex podcast on Relay FM I‚Äôve become interested in their discussions on yearly themes every year. This year I‚Äôve decided to set one for myself.
As I regularly fail New Years resolutions, the idea of setting a theme for the year seemed like a better way to bring about some positive change. There are no rules to the yearly themes. CGP Grey has a good video on the topic that explains it clearly.

  My thoughts about coming back to writing started with an article I read by Ana Rodrigues last month. Long ago I was blogging and sharing links on my own domain before there was Twitter and Facebook. I ran the server off my home computer, that I built myself, and wrote the HTML on a document that I uploaded with FTP. Back then I experimented with Linux, FreeBSD and different content management systems.
