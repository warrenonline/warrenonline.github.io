          <h2>Longevity</h2>
          <h3>2021-02-27</h3>
          <p>I had struggled with acid reflux for a long time. The constant nausea and burning made things pretty miserable for me. It hit my mental and physical health in a big way. I ate antacids like popcorn, but not much seemed to help. Not until I was prescribed <a href="https://www.drugs.com/monograph/esomeprazole.html">esomeprazole magnesium</a> which is a proton-pump inhibitor sold under the brand name <a href="https://www.drugs.com/nexium.html">Nexium</a>. This was a game changer for me. My acid reflux symptoms disappeared and it was amazing. I think it was because of this that I didn‚Äôt pay close enough attention to the side effects. With my last refill of the esomeprazole magnesium I took a much longer look at it. I have been taking esomeprazole magnesium daily and pretty much eating whatever I wanted for about a year or so.</p>
<p><strong>Esomeprazole is usually given for 4 to 8 weeks only. Your doctor may recommend a second course of treatment if you need additional healing time.</strong></p>
<p>When I had a look at the <a href="https://www.drugs.com/sfx/esomeprazole-side-effects.html">side effects</a> and the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6728776/">long term risks</a> I knew I just had to stop the esomeprazole and make some lifestyle changes.
I <a href="https://solitarian.ca/blog/running">run 3 - 4 times a week</a> but I still weigh in at just under 100 kg. I know that‚Äôs unhealthy, but I‚Äôve been feeling good so I probably didn‚Äôt pay enough attention to that as well. At 53 it‚Äôs something I should be on top of.  I want to be around long enough to see what my kids do with their lives üíï. I‚Äôve decided to taper off the esomeprazole from a daily dose to 3 times a week. I‚Äôll see how that progresses and taper down from there. I think the tapering will be important to maintain my physical and mental health. I‚Äôd be an idiot to think that was going to solve the problem though.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm going to have to approach this the same way I did with running. This also fits in well with my <a href="https://solitarian.ca/blog/yearly-theme">yearly theme</a>. I‚Äôm going to use the <a href="https://www.myfitnesspal.com/">My Fitness Pal</a> application to keep track of calories and how I‚Äôm eating. I find food tracking difficult, so I‚Äôm going to pair this with the ‚ÄúFood Notes‚Äù option at the bottom for a kind of food journal. I had thought about using a separate app for this, but I didn‚Äôt want to over complicate it. I‚Äôm going to have to pay more attention to what I‚Äôm eating, how much I‚Äôm eating and when. I need to control my diet and lose weight.</p>
<p>I know I can succeed at this. I‚Äôm going to use all the tools I have to stay on the positive track I‚Äôve been on for a while now.</p>

      
          <h2>Running</h2>
          <h3>2021-01-30</h3>
          <p>After my last post about my <a href="https://solitarian.ca/blog/yearly-theme/">yearly theme</a> I thought I‚Äôd write some posts about what I actually do to take care of myself in 2021. One of the biggest changes I‚Äôve made started prior to 2021 that will be with me for years to come is running. I‚Äôm not a particularly fast runner, but I am proud of the progression I‚Äôve made since I started.</p>
<p>A while back I was at a low point in my life where I was mentally depleted and physically unhealthy. It felt pretty bleak. I looked back to periods of my life when I did feel better. When I was in training I had to run despite hating it and I felt good once I got going. I had nothing else, so I decided to run.</p>
<p>In the beginning I went out for short runs a few times and couldn‚Äôt get the rhythm right. I struggled with lack of fitness and I was having trouble with motivation. I read articles on how to run but nothing stuck. I‚Äôve been a geek my whole life, so I finally looked to technology to give me a boost. One of the articles I read mentioned the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/adidas-runtastic-running-app/id336599882">Runtastic</a> app, so I gave it a try. Runtastic, now owned by Adidas, had built in training plans for beginners. I started a couch to 5K plan and that got me moving. The plan started with a walk / run combo at 15 minutes at a time and it made all the difference. The app gave me a plan, a schedule and the motivation to get out the door and move. Routine was key.</p>
<p>If it wasn‚Äôt for the tech the got me going I don‚Äôt think that I would consider myself a runner today. The Runtastic app started me with a progressive plan and milestones I could achieve. My Apple watch and iPhone provide my heart rate, distances, GPS and entertainment. I listen to <a href="https://relay.fm">podcasts</a> and music while I run. I still use Runtastic for running plans and I run a minimum of 3 times a week now. My longest run so far has been 17 kilometres and I‚Äôve run over 2 hours continuously . I‚Äôm proud of how far I‚Äôve come and what I‚Äôve accomplished so far.</p>
<p>Running has changed me for the better. I run at least 3 times a week in any kind of weather. The physical activity has massively boosted my mental health. My motivation to run has become discipline and it‚Äôs brought positive change to every part of my life. To be honest, when I was in that bleak part of my life I never thought I‚Äôd get here. A hard run can beat me up, but I wake up energized now and I feel good. In a year of self care or if your mental heath is depleted I believe physical exercise is the first place to start. If I didn‚Äôt take the first steps to change things for myself I think my life would be very different right now.</p>

      
          <h2>Yearly Theme</h2>
          <h3>2020-12-31</h3>
          <p>As a regular listener to the <a href="https://www.relay.fm/cortex">Cortex</a> podcast on <a href="https://www.relay.fm">Relay FM</a> I‚Äôve become interested in their discussions on <a href="https://www.relay.fm/cortex/110">yearly themes</a> every year. This year I‚Äôve decided to set one for myself.</p>
<p>As I regularly fail New Years resolutions, the idea of setting a theme for the year seemed like a better way to bring about some positive change. There are no rules to the yearly themes. CGP Grey has a <a href="https://youtu.be/NVGuFdX5guE">good video</a> on the topic that explains it clearly.  This year I‚Äôve decided the theme will be <strong>Year of Self-Care</strong>.</p>
<p>I did a lot of thinking to get to this yearly theme. With a title like ‚ÄòYear of Self-Care‚Äô it sounds self indulgent. This isn‚Äôt the case as this is not a year to spoil myself or go to excess. I‚Äôve learned that when I am in a good place with myself I am at my best. I am happier, more creative and interact better with the world. This is also clear in my relationship with my family. When I feel better I can be more patient and communicative. The previous year has been difficult for everyone, so I‚Äôm going to bring about some positive change for myself. This should result in positive change for the people around me.</p>
<p>I see the Year of Self-Care having two main pillars. Physical Health and Mental Health. This isn‚Äôt a year of self-improvement because I don‚Äôt see myself in a bad place and needing to be fixed. The idea is to make good choices around physical and mental health to bring about positive change.</p>
<p>The first thing I‚Äôm doing for the Year of Self-Care is this blog post. I believe the act of writing this down is a creative process that will go directly to my mental health. Just getting this post up onto the web got me out of my own head and working on some of my old hobbies. I enjoyed the process and it didn‚Äôt feel like work, therefore it is good for the Year of Self-Care.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs to a better year in 2021!</p>

      
          <h2>My First Post</h2>
          <h3>2020-11-10</h3>
          <p>My thoughts about coming back to writing started with an <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/08/autonomy-online-indieweb/">article</a> I read by <a href="https://ohhelloana.blog">Ana Rodrigues</a> last month. Long ago I was blogging and sharing links on my own domain before there was Twitter and Facebook. I ran the server off my home computer, that I built myself, and wrote the HTML on a document that I uploaded with FTP. Back then I experimented with Linux, FreeBSD and different content management systems. I was continually learning and generally doing it by breaking things and fixing them. I had a pretty good time with all of it.</p>
<p>Over the years my work and my little family kind of eroded how I did things. I started using Twitter on a flip phone and I remember signing up for Facebook long ago. It was easier than the way I had been doing it, so my blog posting eventually tapered off to nothing. I let my domain name expire and never thought twice about the fact that I didn‚Äôt actually own my own data anymore. I‚Äôve always run a home server, except its now an Ubuntu media server that I was using to provide movies to my kids. Even that has become something that will end soon as they spend the majority of their time on YouTube. I stopped building and became a passive consumer of content.</p>
<p>After reading about <a href="https://indieweb.org">IndieWeb</a>, it seemed like a throwback to the times I worked on all my own things. Things have changed a lot&hellip; I have a gigabit fibre connection to my house, but I‚Äôm not going to host my own server. The ease of getting a small <a href="https://digitalocean.com">virtual private server</a> these days makes the physical hardware pretty unnecessary. I‚Äôm not going to build my own machines because I just prefer my iMac now. I wrote this first post in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown">Markdown</a> on an iPad. These are things I never could have predicted way back when I first started all this, so I‚Äôm going to mix the new with the old.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm looking forward to picking up my old hobbies again. It probably has a lot to do with nostalgia and my kids getting older. I‚Äôm going to work through  polishing my skills that have gotten rusty and adding new ones as I go.</p>
