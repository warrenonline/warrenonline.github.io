            <h1>Yearly Theme</h1> 
            <h3>2020-12-31</h3>   
        <p>As a regular listener to the <a href="https://www.relay.fm/cortex">Cortex</a> podcast on <a href="https://www.relay.fm">Relay FM</a> I’ve become interested in their discussions on <a href="https://www.relay.fm/cortex/110">yearly themes</a> every year. This year I’ve decided to set one for myself.</p>
<p>As I regularly fail New Years resolutions, the idea of setting a theme for the year seemed like a better way to bring about some positive change. There are no rules to the yearly themes. CGP Grey has a <a href="https://youtu.be/NVGuFdX5guE">good video</a> on the topic that explains it clearly.  This year I’ve decided the theme will be <strong>Year of Self-Care</strong>.</p>
<p>I did a lot of thinking to get to this yearly theme. With a title like ‘Year of Self-Care’ it sounds self indulgent. This isn’t the case as this is not a year to spoil myself or go to excess. I’ve learned that when I am in a good place with myself I am at my best. I am happier, more creative and interact better with the world. This is also clear in my relationship with my family. When I feel better I can be more patient and communicative. The previous year has been difficult for everyone, so I’m going to bring about some positive change for myself. This should result in positive change for the people around me.</p>
<p>I see the Year of Self-Care having two main pillars. Physical Health and Mental Health. This isn’t a year of self-improvement because I don’t see myself in a bad place and needing to be fixed. The idea is to make good choices around physical and mental health to bring about positive change.</p>
<p>The first thing I’m doing for the Year of Self-Care is this blog post. I believe the act of writing this down is a creative process that will go directly to my mental health. Just getting this post up onto the web got me out of my own head and working on some of my old hobbies. I enjoyed the process and it didn’t feel like work, therefore it is good for the Year of Self-Care.</p>
<p>Here’s to a better year in 2021!</p>

        
            <h1>My First Post</h1> 
            <h3>2020-11-10</h3>   
        <p>My thoughts about coming back to writing started with an <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/08/autonomy-online-indieweb/">article</a> I read by <a href="https://ohhelloana.blog">Ana Rodrigues</a> last month. Long ago I was blogging and sharing links on my own domain before there was Twitter and Facebook. I ran the server off my home computer, that I built myself, and wrote the HTML on a document that I uploaded with FTP. Back then I experimented with Linux, FreeBSD and different content management systems. I was continually learning and generally doing it by breaking things and fixing them. I had a pretty good time with all of it.</p>
<p>Over the years my work and my little family kind of eroded how I did things. I started using Twitter on a flip phone and I remember signing up for Facebook long ago. It was easier than the way I had been doing it, so my blog posting eventually tapered off to nothing. I let my domain name expire and never thought twice about the fact that I didn’t actually own my own data anymore. I’ve always run a home server, except its now an Ubuntu media server that I was using to provide movies to my kids. Even that has become something that will end soon as they spend the majority of their time on YouTube. I stopped building and became a passive consumer of content.</p>
<p>After reading about <a href="https://indieweb.org">IndieWeb</a>, it seemed like a throwback to the times I worked on all my own things. Things have changed a lot&hellip; I have a gigabit fibre connection to my house, but I’m not going to host my own server. The ease of getting a small <a href="https://digitalocean.com">virtual private server</a> these days makes the physical hardware pretty unnecessary. I’m not going to build my own machines because I just prefer my iMac now. I wrote this first post in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown">Markdown</a> on an iPad. These are things I never could have predicted way back when I first started all this, so I’m going to mix the new with the old.</p>
<p>I’m looking forward to picking up my old hobbies again. It probably has a lot to do with nostalgia and my kids getting older. I’m going to work through  polishing my skills that have gotten rusty and adding new ones as I go.</p>
